== Documentation ==

SoldPress uses Shortcode syntax to intergrate listing content on your WordPress site.

`[soldpress-listing listingkey="11937198" template="template.html"]`


**Listing Key**

There are two methods to specify a Listing Key.

* Option A : Specifiy Listing Key in the Shortcode.

	`[soldpress-listing listingkey="11937198" template="template.html"]`

* Option B : Specify Listing Key in QueryString

	`?ListingKey=11937198`

*The QueryString ListingKey paramerter superseeds the Shortcode.*


**Templates**

SoldPress uses a basic template enginge to render html output. A SoldPress template is a text file that contains variables, which get replaced with values when the template is evaluated. The template engine is based on heredoc syntax.

The general syntax is `${$rets['ListPrice']}`. 

A comprehensive list of variable names and descriptions can be found at in the [Data Distribution Facility Documentation](http://crea.ca/data-distribution-facility-documentation).


The default template location is wp-content/plugins/soldpress/template/
